Kickstart-GAppEngine
====================

Experiments with Google App Engine. Lets see where we end up with this!
Too much crap in the repository presently. Will remove all the additional sample codes from my local repo and commit again when I do find the time.
I think I got some basic stuff running in the hjunky folder and a few others.
I promise to clean up (huge clean up drive to be initiated) sometime.
Until then everyone's welcome to gimme feedback or add some App engine codes in here. In the end, hope to make this a good code repo for anyone who wants to get started with App Engine.
